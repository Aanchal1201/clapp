Also included are some long requested improvements to vertical alignment and a handful of <strong>updates to tags and categories.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keep reading for a preview of the new icons and how icon alignment has changed.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>60+ weather ic</strong>ons</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New icons in v1.4.0\" src=\"https://blog.getbootstrap.com/assets/img/2021/02/v140-new-icons.png\" style=\"height:350px; width:803px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new weather category includes over 60 icons for various weather and atmospheric conditions. From fog and haze to rainstorms and hurricanes, we now have icons for just about every weather situation. We undoubtedly have some more work to do to refine and add to this new category, but it&rsquo;s a pretty big addition to the project. Let us know what you think and what&rsquo;s missing so we can keep adding to it over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Alignment changes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Alignment changes\" src=\"https://blog.getbootstrap.com/assets/img/2021/02/v140-alignment.png\" style=\"height:366px; width:1022px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also new in v1.4.0 are some alignment changes&mdash;before and after are shown above. Previously we used&nbsp;<code>vertical-align: text-top</code>&nbsp;in our CSS to aligning individual icons. This wasn&rsquo;t as much of an issue when we only had SVGs, but with the addition of icon fonts and their generated CSS in v1.2.0, we had to make some changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New in this release is a change to&nbsp;<code>vertical-align: -.125em</code>. This new alignment is similar to that found in the tried and true&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fontawesome.com/\">Font Awesome</a>&nbsp;project. This change essentially raises icons up about 1px to better vertically center them with nearby text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may not be perfect in all implementations, so additional changes might still be needed, but this should give you a stronger baseline to start (pun intended). Should you still run into issues, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to open an issue on GitHub.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>And more&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve also made several updates under the hood, from dependencies to build tools. This has resulted in improved speeds for our development scripts and more resilient tooling for packaging our icons. We&rsquo;ve also included category names into the fuzzy search on the homepage, making it a lot easier to search for groups of icons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still have some work to do on our docs and search, so stay tuned as we&rsquo;ll eventually add category pages and more for easier browsing and navigating. If you&rsquo;re reading this and want to help improve the Bootstrap Icons docs, please consider opening a PR anytime.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Install</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To get started, install via npm:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>npm i bootstrap-icons\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/tag/v1.4.0\">download the release from GitHub</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/icons/releases/download/v1.4.0/bootstrap-icons-1.4.0.zip\">download just the SVGs and fonts</a>&nbsp;(without the rest of the repository files).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Figma</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Figma users out there, you can also snag the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/tZZVOiEgKcRUHE3s6o5djB/Bootstrap-Icons-v1.4.0?node-id=0%3A1\">icons from Figma</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a href=\"https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2021/02/10/bootstrap-5-beta-2/\">Bootstrap 5 Beta 2</a></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mdo\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://github.com/mdo.png?size=32\" style=\"height:32px; width:32px\" />@mdo</a>February 10, 2021</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our second beta has arrived for Bootstrap 5! We delayed its release to iron out some issues with third-party libraries and stabilize our major changes. We&rsquo;ve also once again shipped some awesome updates to our documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up is our final beta, which we may even promote to a stable release depending on how development proceeds. Stay tuned for that!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dropdowns</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/dropdowns/\"><img alt=\"Dropdown docs screenshot\" src=\"https://blog.getbootstrap.com/assets/img/2021/02/bootstrap-v5b2-dropdowns.png\" style=\"height:547px; width:901px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dropdowns saw a lot of work in Beta 2 because of how much has changed in both our JavaScript and in Popper.js (which we depend on for most dropdown, popover, and toolip positioning). We&rsquo;ve modified our dropdown plugin to add a new data attribute to help separate our own positioning styles with that of Popper&rsquo;s. The issues we saw&mdash;like a&nbsp;<code>.dropstart</code>&nbsp;menu overlapping a button or an incorrect responsive&nbsp;<code>.dropdown-menu-end</code>&nbsp;class&mdash;were largely the result of competing positioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now when dropdown menus have&nbsp;<code>data-bs-display=&quot;static&quot;</code>, we&rsquo;ll add&nbsp;<code>data-bs-popper=&quot;static&quot;</code>&nbsp;via JavaScript to their associated&nbsp;<code>.dropdown-menu</code>. When dropdowns are in our navbars, their menus will have&nbsp;<code>data-bs-popper=&quot;none&quot;</code>&nbsp;added. This separates two different positioning libraries, ours and Poppers, and ensures all behaviors are supported. You can see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/dropdowns/#alignment-options\">all the options in a new example in our docs</a>. We updated our CSS selectors to use these new data attributes, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, we&rsquo;ve removed the initial&nbsp;<code>margin</code>s from dropdowns and popovers, instead of relying on Popper&rsquo;s offsets. These also conflicted with the default styling for elements positioned by Popper.js. Relatedly, there was a bug in how popover arrows were aligned that has now been resolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Color utility docs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/colors/\"><img alt=\"Sass docs screenshot\" src=\"https://blog.getbootstrap.com/assets/img/2021/02/bootstrap-v5b2-sass-docs.png\" style=\"height:460px; width:758px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve overhauled our color utility documentation, separating the text&nbsp;<code>color</code>&nbsp;classes from our&nbsp;<code>background-color</code>&nbsp;ones. We&rsquo;ve also made extensive use of our&nbsp;<code>scss-docs</code>&nbsp;shortcode to include tons more code snippets in our docs.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/colors/\">Text color utilities</a>&nbsp;remain on their existing page.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/\">Background utilities</a>&nbsp;have moved to a new page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Both pages now include a new Sass section, showing relevant snippets of our source code that are related to each set of utilities. We list all our available color variables, our theme color variables and maps, associated mixins and loops, and even where these utilities are generated in the utilities API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expect this kind of documentation improvements to continue into our next release. Follow along in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/32747\">draft pull request that adds Sass docs to all our components</a>&nbsp;on GitHub.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>JS updates</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of time in Beta 2 improving our JavaScript plugins to fix bugs and improve behaviors since dropping jQuery.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Dropdown now emits events on the&nbsp;<code>.dropdown-toggle</code>&nbsp;instead of the&nbsp;<code>.dropdown</code>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Restored the offset option for dropdowns.</li>\r\n\t<li>Fixed modal toggling when clicking on&nbsp;<code>data-bs-toggle=&quot;modal&quot;</code>.</li>\r\n\t<li>We now build our base component as a separate&nbsp;<code>.js</code>&nbsp;file.</li>\r\n\t<li>We now prevent&nbsp;<code>getSelector</code>&nbsp;from returning URLs as selector which caused errors in dropdown and scrollspy plugins.</li>\r\n\t<li>Refactored components to use a utility function to define jQuery plugins</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Miscellaneous updates</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the board, we&rsquo;ve made a few small changes to other components that are worth a brief mention here.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Navbars:</strong>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Added a new&nbsp;<code>.navbar-nav-scroll</code>&nbsp;class to enable vertical scrolling when a collapsed navbar is opened. It&rsquo;s customizable via Sass and a CSS variable.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/#scrolling\">Read more in the docs.</a></li>\r\n\t\t<li>We&rsquo;ve re-added&nbsp;<code>flex-grow</code>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<code>.navbar-collapse</code>&nbsp;to restore the flexbox behaviors from v4 and prevent some content from being inadvertently squished.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Forms:</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Removed&nbsp;<code>vertical-align</code>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<code>.form-select</code></li>\r\n\t\t<li>Form validation mixin updated with additional parameters</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Fixed validation icon placement in&nbsp;<code>.form-select</code></li>\r\n\t\t<li>Checkboxes and radio buttons are aligned better in input groups</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Buttons:</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Added variables for tinting and shading button state colors</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Suppressed the default focus outline for buttons in Chromium</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Toasts:</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Added&nbsp;<code>word-break</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>.toast-body</code></li>\r\n\t\t<li>Added a live example to the docs to trigger a real toast</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Bundles:</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Added our helpers to the utilities CSS bundle</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Carousels:</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Updated docs examples to use&nbsp;<code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s wherever possible instead of&nbsp;<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>CSS selectors changed for using&nbsp;<code>&lt;button&gt;</code>s as indicators (from&nbsp;<code>.carousel-indicators li</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>.carousel-indicators [data-bs-target]</code>).</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For a more complete list of changes, check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects/33\">v5 Beta 2 project board</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+project%3Atwbs%2Fbootstrap%2F33\">list of issues and PRs</a>&nbsp;in this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta2\">release</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get started</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Head to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">https://getbootstrap.com</a>&nbsp;to explore the new release.</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve also published this updated as a pre-release to npm, so if you&rsquo;re feeling bold or are curious about what&rsquo;s new, you can pull the latest in that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>npm i bootstrap@next\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s next</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We have three releases coming up next for the team:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bootstrap v5.0.0-beta3 (possibly promoted to v5 stable)</li>\r\n\t<li>Bootstrap v4.6.1 (bringing in some more bugfixes and alignment with the latest in v5)</li>\r\n\t<li>Bootstrap Icons v1.4.0</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Our v5 Beta 3 will continue to focus on JavaScript issues and documentation improvements. Tooltips in particular need some attention after our fixes to dropdowns and popovers. After v5 goes stable, we&rsquo;ll look to adding some of the awesome features we&rsquo;ve built up in our backlog.

Programming and web development is a billion dollar business now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that programmers get paid thousands of dollars every single month and it is one of the most demanding jobs worldwide? Apart from the list of best web design blogs 2021 you found above, here are few top tip especially for programming beginners to learn and master their coding skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learn and master the basics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any programming language, it&rsquo;s essential for you to learn the basics first. Once you get the basics right, mastering the programming language can become much easier. Don&rsquo;t think about learning a programming language within a week or month (or don&rsquo;t fall for the gimmicks of online courses that promise you quick results) as learning basics take time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It varies from person to person and depends on their mathematical skills and interests, learning the basics can be either easier or harder. Just remember that, beginning is always the hardest so take baby steps and learn everything about the programming language you want to master.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find a programming buddy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the easiest ways to learn programming and coding is to find a partner who has similar coding interests. You can either contact your local friends, office mates or college friends to find and learn with a programming partner or you can use online communities to find buddies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use online communities such as;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>freeCodeCamp</li>\r\n\t<li>Reddit programming buddies</li>\r\n\t<li>Quora etc</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a ton of coding enthusiasts just like you who are also looking to learn coding with a partner, so go search and you&rsquo;ll get constant inspiration to learn and master coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Code by hand</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bloggerspassion.com/best-programming-blogs/\" target=\"_blank\">top programmer</a>&nbsp;the fastest way to code and most of them will say &ldquo;code by hand&rdquo;. Writing code on a paper requires a ton of programming skills because you&rsquo;ll not be taking any help from compilers or web servers to insert the code (such as strings, asterisks etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to really learn the programming languages at deep level, writing code by hand is the only effective way to go. There are also so many companies recruiting based on your performance and your ability to code by hand so it is a great skill to learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learn by doing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s the point of finding the best coding blogs or best web development blogs to learn coding if you don&rsquo;t actually start implementing what you learn?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll find a ton of resources such as videos, tutorials, references online for free to learn how to code but you&rsquo;ll only be able to code when you actually start doing it. You can use free sites like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://programmingbydoing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Programming by Doing</a>&nbsp;to teach yourself programming and also using their interactive tools such as compilers to actually start coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are few more places where you can learn by doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>freeCodeCamp</li>\r\n\t<li>Code Academy</li>\r\n\t<li>Code School</li>\r\n\t<li>Treehouse etc</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Always seek advice</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Websites like Stack Overflow, GitHub are excellent resources for learning how to code and web development.

Well, as you probably know if you&rsquo;re in the field, that&rsquo;s simply not the case, nor are some of the things developers themselves believe about the industry. Let&rsquo;s debug those myths:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>10x Developer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Both developers and recruiters want to believe that there&rsquo;s a special breed of developer that can work 10x faster and better than the average developer. This mythical developer doesn&rsquo;t exist as media portrays him/her. It is true that there are developers who are significantly more productive, but this is usually just a matter of experience and knowledge. Still, you can&rsquo;t expect to replace 10 developers with a single person, it just doesn&rsquo;t work that way. The usual hindrances for projects have nothing to do with developers, and more to do with mismanagement and inefficiencies. Instead of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.jixee.me/how-to-become-a-10x-engineer/\">looking for this unicorn</a>&nbsp;of a programmer, look for someone who knows their stuff, has proven their ability to deliver quality, and enhances the team dynamic &mdash; skills any senior engineer should possess.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Good Coders Work Around the Clock</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where we insert a picture of Silicon Valley: a room of hoodie-clad guys hooked up to Red Bull IVs. There&rsquo;s some truth to this, especially with startups. However, it doesn&rsquo;t always have to be this way, and research would suggest that long hours and sleep deprivation don&rsquo;t actually increase productivity. In reality, there&rsquo;s a blurred line between effort and progress, and usually an outcome of unrealistic expectations. Plenty of developers have families and lives outside of programming, and would rather leave the office at a normal time. Instead of allowing that idea to persist, the programming community would benefit from looking at ways to improve workflow, and set realistic goals with agile methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/work-please-now-fvXlQVgrzUedi\">via GIPHY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Offshoring Leads to Cheaper, Faster Software</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Offshoring usually does the opposite, companies are only attracted to the idea because it&nbsp;<em>seems</em>&nbsp;cheaper. However, hiring more programmers for less money definitely doesn&rsquo;t mean faster. It involves more communication overhead, training, and effort in repartitioning. Offshore development teams are also prone to higher turnover rates, meaning that the long-run desired effect becomes void. In this case, the in-house team has to pick up the slack and savings diminish.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Offshoring Will Destroy Your Career</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned above, offshoring doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lead to cheaper software done faster. People will continue to try this model until it has proven worthless, but offshoring is not going to suck all the jobs from the U.S. The facts remain: language does matter. Attempting to communicate with offshore managers and teams is unreliable, and tumultuous. Clients normally run out of money or patience dealing with offshore teams and turn back to the dev shops in the country where contracts can be better enforced.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The More People Checking, The Fewer Bugs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric S. Raymond coined the term, &ldquo;given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&rdquo;. It is a commonly held belief that in open source software that bugs will be found, reviewed, and fixed, because anyone can take action. Truly, more people are using open source software than contributing, and most are not capable of correcting mistakes in code. In other words, too many cooks spoil the broth. A better way to is to use a concentrated team equipped with great bug tracking software.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Math Skills Determine Coding Skills</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes and no. Math skills don&rsquo;t necessarily translate into being a good developer. If someone isn&rsquo;t mathematically inclined, they may be better at certain aspects of programming that require one to be clever or practical. Outside of gaming, most developers are only using basic algebra and statistics to find out how efficient the code is, and even that is minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Developers are Geniuses</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be a genius to be a programmer, you just need the drive and ability to learn. Programmers are constantly faced with mistakes that can be frustrating, and the best developers are those that can fail repeatedly and learn from mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You Can Specialize in Just One Thing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning never stops because the world of programming moves at light speed. It&rsquo;s smart to master a language, because you&rsquo;ll have an ability to work well and understand the nuances. However, never get stuck only knowing how to do one thing, you&rsquo;ll end up knowing about &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; software no one uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Language X is Better</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is not one, magic language for all of coding. Rather, every language fills a special niche in the coding environment. That doesn&rsquo;t mean some languages aren&rsquo;t better at one thing over another &mdash; you might use Javascript for interactive software, but C++ if you want to do something fast. Developers, keep bickering amongst yourselves, there&rsquo;s no one perfect language.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You Can Master a Language in a Few Weeks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You may be able to learn the basic tenets of a language in two or three weeks, but you surely cannot be a master. Mastering a language requires interest, patience, and most importantly &mdash; application. You wouldn&rsquo;t want a doctor operating on you if they had only read all the medical textbooks and taken the tests, you want someone who has spent countless hours actually participating in surgeries. Well think of yourself as a surgeon, because the same muscle memory is needed to be a good developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Software Crisis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1968, Edgar Dijkstra talked about the &lsquo;software crisis&rsquo;, which referred to building software that was inefficient, over budget, low quality, and difficult to maintain. Today, the fact that &lsquo;buggy&rsquo; software costs the U.S. billions of dollars purports the &lsquo;crisis&rsquo; although there&rsquo;s no real crisis to speak of. Software isn&rsquo;t doing too bad, it&rsquo;s always improving. It commands a large chunk of the economy while moving at lightning speed, and there will always be hiccups in efficiency as new software emerges. No need to panic, the crisis is a myth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When You Ship Software, You&rsquo;re Done</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Software is rarely finished. Sure, management and developers would love to believe that large, multi-layered a software is in constant flux, the developers who made the software aren&rsquo;t perfect, applications change, added features introduce new bugs. Management and teams need to consider support and maintenance costs, and account for continual innovation that a product must upkeep to stay competitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Coding is Simply the Act of Writing Code</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Management often thinks that developers are just translating an ideation into code, without understanding the decisions that developers make along the way. It&rsquo;s quite the misunderstanding, because developers are building and making decisions for the project every step of the way. There are plenty of non-functional requirements and design decisions that developers make every day, and good developers are ones that can track those, communicate important decisions with a team, and make executive decisions on minor details.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It&rsquo;s not a creative field</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes it&rsquo;s technical &amp; logical, but it&rsquo;s also an art form. Many non-programmers overlook the beauty in construction of code, and some developers may even believe this too. Many programmers would say it&rsquo;s like poetry. It&rsquo;s absolutely a creative effort. Paul Graham outlines the artistry of coding in his essay&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html\"><em>Hackers and Painters.</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Developers Have Poor Social Skills:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of people have the idea that programmers are loners who like to sit alone with their computers and code all the time, and when faced with social situations aren&rsquo;t savvy contributors to an organization. Frequently, this leads managers to interact with developers in a way that underestimates the contribution of a development team. When managers do this, they are putting themselves at risk for a resentful team. Developers make decisions constantly in their code, and come in all shapes and sizes, just because you enjoy coding doesn&rsquo;t mean you prefer solitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Image for post\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/398/0*bqnLtTgMYMoeoUnq.gif\" style=\"height:229px; width:398px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Developers Think Managers have Nothing to Contribute</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Developers often operate under the belief that managers have no skills and are useless in guiding the development team. This isn&rsquo;t true, most managers really know what their doing, and exist to shield their team from distraction, provide them with the best tools, and manage deadlines, budgets, and bring in extra resources when needed. People tend to focus on the negatives, so managers get blamed when things get frustrating, but<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/06/on-managing-developers/\">&nbsp;their purpose</a>&nbsp;is to make things run more smoothly for their team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Young Developers Think They&rsquo;re Hotshots</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just a symptom of age, but developers early in their career tend to think they are better than experienced developers. They learned a new technology they believe to be more productive, and are in turn more valuable than someone using old platforms. Many developers continue to learn new technology as they get older, as they should. The fresh out of college developers are overlooking an important factor: the depth and breadth of experience that only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.devmynd.com/blog/2015-1-pairing-with-junior-developers/\">comes with time</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Programming is Boring</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone is bored by something, but you don&rsquo;t dedicate your life to something that bores you. Coding can be fascinating, it&rsquo;s a mix of architecture, math, and language. People who think coding is boring don&rsquo;t understand the intricacies, but developers know that coding is all about coming up with solutions and learning &mdash; how could that be boring?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Developer&rsquo;s Career is Over at 35</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ageism in the programming world is real, but age is not what ends a career. Individuals who get stuck in one language, or fail to learn new platforms and technologies contribute to their own waning relevance. This is not to say that developers leave programming entirely, many move into management positions or start their own companies. Others continue learning and loving developing for their entire career, it&rsquo;s just a matter of staying up-to-date.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Developers are a Commodity</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Often people think a person who writes more lines of codes is more productive, but developing isn&rsquo;t brick laying. Hiring cheaper programmers and expecting the job done exactly the same is irrational. Developers are people! They have specific skills, personalities, and knowledge. Like a language, some programmers will be better at one project than another, and that&rsquo;s what will influence efficiency.</p>", "userStatus": "publish", "adminStatus": true}}, {"model": "blog.userpost", "pk": 7, "fields": {"authorUsername": 5, "title": "Programming Blogs to Improve Your Skills", "label": "For good programming", "category": "For learning programming", "image": "images/userPost/branko-stancevic-GI1hwOGqGtE-unsplash.jpg", "slug": "Programming-Blogs-to-Improve-Your-Skills", "author": "Kamna", "dateUpdate": "2021-03-09T14:44:48.260", "timeStamp": "2021-03-05T23:08:13.001", "timeRead": "5 min", "content": "<p>It&rsquo;s important to follow trends in your field to ensure you&rsquo;re staying current on standards and protocols and perhaps more so in the field of coding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programmers of all specialties can benefit from following industry-leading blogs to stay aware of the latest technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://catswhocode.com/programming-blogs/#\">show</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a coder of any sort you&rsquo;ll want to subscribe to these useful programming blogs written by the top blogging coders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these bloggers has made a name for themselves in the programming community by sharing relevant, high-quality information and tips for coders.

For one thing, saying, &ldquo;I want to get better&rdquo; assumes that you recognize what &ldquo;better&rdquo; looks like. Plus, too many people aim for improvement without any sense of how to get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let me share eight&nbsp;<em>actionable</em>&nbsp;guidelines that can act as a flowchart to improving your programming skills. These tidbits of wisdom are gathered from 35 years in the computer industry, many of which were spent as a lowly grasshopper at the feet of some of the people who defined and documented it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Remind yourself how much you have to learn</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"learning concept: become a better coder\" src=\"https://blog.newrelic.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_124386907-300x300.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step in learning something is recognizing that you don&rsquo;t know it. That sounds obvious, but experienced programmers remember how long it took to overcome this personal assumption. Too many computer science students graduate with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.javaworld.com/article/2072856/software-development-and-the-pink-pony-backpack.html\" target=\"_blank\">an arrogant &ldquo;I know best&rdquo; bravado</a>, a robust certainty that they know everything and the intense need to prove it to every new work colleague. In other words: Your &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m doing!&rdquo; attitude can get in the way of learning anything new.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Stop trying to prove yourself right</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To become great&mdash;not just good&mdash;you have to learn from experience. But be careful, experience can teach us to repeat poor behavior and to create bad habits. We&rsquo;ve all encountered programmers with eight years of experience&nbsp;&hellip; the same year of experience, repeated eight times. To avoid that syndrome, look at everything you do and ask yourself, &ldquo;How can I make this better?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Novice software developers (and too many experienced ones) look at their code to admire its wonderfulness. They&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2009/08/24/writing-great-unit-tests-best-and-worst-practises/\" target=\"_blank\">write tests to prove that their code works</a>&nbsp;instead of trying&nbsp;to make it fail. Truly great programmers actively&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2373826/careers-staffing/careers-staffing-fighting-the-superstitions-of-software-development-questioning-the-assumptions.html\" target=\"_blank\">look for where they&rsquo;re wrong</a>&mdash;because they know that eventually users will find the defects they missed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. &ldquo;The code works&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t where you stop; it&rsquo;s where you start</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, your first step is always to write quality software that fulfills the spec. Average programmers quit at that point and move on to the next thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to stop once it&rsquo;s &ldquo;done&rdquo; is like taking a snapshot and expecting it to be a work of art. Great programmers know that the first iteration is just the first iteration. It works&mdash; congratulations!&mdash;but you aren&rsquo;t done. Now,&nbsp;<em>make it better</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of that process is defining what &ldquo;better&rdquo; means. Is it valuable to make it faster? Easier to document? More reusable? More reliable? The answer varies with each application, but the process doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Write it three times</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Good programmers write software that works. Great ones write software that works exceedingly well. That rarely happens on the first try. The best software usually is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.javaworld.com/article/2072651/becoming-a-great-programmer--use-your-trash-can.html\" target=\"_blank\">written three times</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>First, you write the software to prove to yourself (or a client) that the solution is possible. Others may not recognize that this is just a proof-of-concept, but you do.</li>\r\n\t<li>The second time, you make it work.</li>\r\n\t<li>The third time, you make it work&nbsp;<em>right</em>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This level of work may not be obvious when you look at the work of the best developers. Everything they do seems so brilliant, but what you don&rsquo;t see is that even rock-star developers probably threw out the first and second versions before showing their software to anyone else.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.daedtech.com/throw-out-your-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Throwing away code</a>&nbsp;and starting over can be a powerful way to include &ldquo;make it better&rdquo; into your personal workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If nothing else, &ldquo;Write it three times&rdquo; teaches you how many ways there are to approach a problem. And it prevents you from getting stuck in a rut.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Read code. Read lots of code</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"read code concept: become a better coder\" src=\"https://blog.newrelic.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_303402542-300x286.jpg\" style=\"height:190px; width:200px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You probably expected me to lead with this advice, and indeed it&rsquo;s both the most common and the most valuable suggestion for improving programming skills. What is less evident are the&nbsp;<em>reasons</em>&nbsp;that reading others&rsquo; code is so important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you read others&rsquo; code, you see how someone else solved a programming problem. But don&rsquo;t treat it as literature; think of it as a lesson and a challenge. To get better, ask yourself:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>How would I have written that block of code?</em>&nbsp;What would you do differently, now that you&rsquo;ve seen another solution?</li>\r\n\t<li><em>What did I learn?</em>&nbsp;How can I apply that technique to code I wrote in the past? (&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have thought to use recursive descent there&hellip;&rdquo;).</li>\r\n\t<li><em>How would I improve this code?</em>&nbsp;And if it&rsquo;s an open source project where you are confident you have a better solution,&nbsp;<em>do it!</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em>Write code in the author&rsquo;s style</em>. Practicing this helps you get into the head of the person who wrote the software, which can&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gamedevwithoutacause.com/?p=1329\" target=\"_blank\">improve your empathy</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t just idly think about these steps. Write out your answers, whether in a personal journal, a blog,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/2431556/developer/5-reasons-for-software-developers-to-do-code-reviews--even-if-you-think-they-re-a-waste-of.html\" target=\"_blank\">in a code review process</a>, or a community forum with other developers. Just as explaining a problem to a friend can help you sort out the solution, writing down and sharing your analysis can help you understand why you react to another person&rsquo;s code in a given way. It&rsquo;s all part of that introspection I mentioned earlier, helping you to dispassionately judge your own strengths and weaknesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warning: It&rsquo;s easy to read a lot of code without becoming a great programmer, just as a wannabe writer can read great literature without improving her own prose. Plenty of developers look at open source or other software to &ldquo;find an answer&rdquo; and, most likely, to copy and paste code that appears to solve a similar problem. Doing that can actually make you a&nbsp;<em>worse</em>&nbsp;programmer, since you are blindly accepting others&rsquo; wisdom without examining it. (Plus, it may be buggier than a summer picnic, but because you didn&rsquo;t take the time to understand it, you&rsquo;ll never recognize that you just imported a bug-factory.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Write code, and not just as assignments</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working on personal programming projects has many advantages. For one, it gives you a way to learn tools and technologies that aren&rsquo;t available at your current job, but which make you more marketable for the next one. Whether you contribute to an open source project or take on pro-bono work for a local community organization, you&rsquo;ll gain tech skills and self-confidence. (Plus, your personal projects demonstrate to would-be employers that you&rsquo;re a self-starter who never stops learning.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another advantage of writing code for fun is that it forces you to figure things out on your own. You can&rsquo;t leave the hard stuff to someone else, so it keeps you from asking for help too soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong>&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t choose only personal projects where you never fail. You need to fail! But you do probably don&rsquo;t want to fail at work or when you have a deadline.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Work one-on-one with other developers any way you can</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"collaborate concept: become a better coder\" src=\"https://blog.newrelic.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_168304187-300x210.jpg\" style=\"height:140px; width:200px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It helps to listen to other people. That might mean pair programming, or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hackathon.io/events\" target=\"_blank\">going to a hackathon</a>, or joining a programming user group (such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/vtcode/\" target=\"_blank\">Vermont Coders Connection</a>). When you contribute to an open source project, pay attention to the feedback you get from users and from other developers. What commonalities do you see in their criticism?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might be lucky enough to find a personal mentor whom you can trust to guide you in everything from coding techniques to career decisions. Don&rsquo;t waste these opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Learn techniques, not tools</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Programming languages, tools, and methodologies come and go. That&rsquo;s why it pays to get as much experience as you can with as many languages and frameworks as possible. Focus on the programming fundamentals, because the basics never change; pay more attention to architecture than to programming. If you feel certain that there&rsquo;s only one right way to do something, it&rsquo;s probably time for a reality check. Dogma can hamper your ability to learn new things, and make you slow to adapt to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could keep going, but a key tenet of self-improvement is knowing when to stop.</p>", "userStatus": "publish", "adminStatus": true}}, {"model": "blog.userpost", "pk": 11, "fields": {"authorUsername": 7, "title": "The History of Programming", "label": "Programmer must have to know  programming history", "category": "Origin of programming", "image": "images/userPost/mr-cup-fabien-barral-Fo5dTm6ID1Y-unsplash.jpg", "slug": "The-History-of-Programming", "author": "Aman", "dateUpdate": "2021-03-09T14:42:14.281", "timeStamp": "2021-03-08T22:13:03.087", "timeRead": "2 min", "content": "<p><img alt=\"History-of-Programming-Devolutions\" src=\"https://webdevolutions.blob.core.windows.net/blog/2017/03/History-of-Programming-Devolutions.png\" style=\"height:339px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you a student of history?

And so, I did some digging on the evolution of programming and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdw.com/content/cdw/en/articles/datacenter/2018/06/08/timeline-of-computer-storage-and-memory.html\" target=\"_blank\">history of storage and memory</a>&nbsp;across the years, and here&rsquo;s what I found:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pre-1940</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first electric computer (which bears zero resemblance to what we use today) was created in the 1940s, but it&rsquo;s interesting to note that a few geniuses were toying with the concept long before that. Way back in 1837, a mathematician named Charles Babbage (rumor has it that his homeboys called him &ldquo;C-BAB&rdquo;) imagined the first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine\" target=\"_blank\">analytical machine</a>. Sadly, he never finished it, but his son (C-BAB2?) put it together in 1910. That baby was a pure steampunk creation in the literal sense &ndash; it used gears and steam. How badass is that? And so, we owe an eternal debt to the Babbages for creating the first programmable &ldquo;computer&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1940s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1940s, programming languages were simple and complex at the same time. And so their inventors realized that limited memory was a problem. Users (if we can call them users) had to optimize machines by doing some manual work, which made them pretty much useless on a mass scale. Here&rsquo;s a list of the programming greatest hits from the 1940s:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>1943:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl\" target=\"_blank\">Plankalk&uuml;l</a>&nbsp;developed by the Germans</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1943 to 1946:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/eniac.html\" target=\"_blank\">ENIAC</a>&nbsp;built by the Moore School of the University of Pennsylvania</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1948:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Small-Scale_Experimental_Machine\" target=\"_blank\">Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine</a>&nbsp;(the world&#39;s first stored-program computer)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1949:</strong>&nbsp;C10 language</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1950s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 50s is when things really shifted into high gear and a lot of new languages emerged &ndash; including three massive ones that are still known today (though in a very modified form):&nbsp;<strong>FORTRAN, LISP and COBOL.</strong>&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s an overview of some of the languages that were born in the 50s:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>1951</strong>: Regional Assembly Language</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1952</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocode\" target=\"_blank\">Autocode</a></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1954</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Processing_Language\" target=\"_blank\">IPL</a>&nbsp;(forerunner to LISP)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1955</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOW-MATIC\" target=\"_blank\">FLOW-MATIC</a>&nbsp;(led to COBOL)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1957</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran\" target=\"_blank\">FORTRAN</a>&nbsp;(First compiler)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1957</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMTRAN\" target=\"_blank\">COMTRAN</a>&nbsp;(precursor to COBOL)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1958</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\">LISP</a></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1958</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_58\" target=\"_blank\">ALGOL 58</a></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1959</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FACT_computer_language\" target=\"_blank\">FACT&nbsp;</a>(forerunner to COBOL)</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1959</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL\" target=\"_blank\">COBOL</a></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>1959</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG\" target=\"_blank\">RPG</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1960s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, while hippies were finding themselves, geeks were programming.

While it is often considered an old-fashioned &mdash; sometimes even ridiculed &mdash; term, the importance of social and emotional intelligence for those who work in software development cannot be underestimated. As much as code quality, technical skills, and other &ldquo;hard&rdquo; aspects of engineering matter, communication and collaboration are what really make a sound engineer great at what they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will not talk about soft skills from a theoretical point of view in this article. Instead, I will aim to give you practical tips on developing your own soft skills to become a better professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What Are Soft Skills?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than the term &ldquo;soft,&rdquo; which is just a way to make them sound a bit less critical (which is absolute nonsense, by the way), soft skills are about how we interact with others and our environment. They&rsquo;re about how you communicate, how you resolve conflicts, and how you manage your emotions. And they&rsquo;re not only crucial for your personal life. They also make or break your career as a software engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an introvert. I don&rsquo;t have good social skills.&rdquo; But it is not that simple! Everyone has some degree of introversion and extroversion. It&rsquo;s all about finding balance. While some people have excellent communication skills, they can still do better in certain areas of their professional life &mdash; and vice versa. Even if you consider yourself shy and socially awkward, there&rsquo;s plenty of room for improvement in your interactions with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, it&rsquo;s never too late to start working on your soft skills, so don&rsquo;t give up before you get started!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What You Need To Know About Soft Skills</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to realize that soft skills are just like any other skill out there. You have to practice them regularly if you want them to improve, which will take some time before becoming second nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that everyone can benefit from working on their soft skills. Even if they seem perfect on the outside, chances are there&rsquo;s room for improvement. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to admit this! Nobody knows everything in life, so why should someone fault us for something we could still improve ourselves?</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What Does It Mean for Your Career?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Soft skills are not just nice to have. They are essential for those who want to work in software development. The information age we live in has made the world smaller and more interconnected than ever before, which means that it&rsquo;s easier than ever to connect with clients, customers, team members, and other stakeholders. At the same time, it&rsquo;s a very competitive industry with lots of opportunities. This means that you have to make an impact to stand out from the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion, the most significant advantage that soft skills provide is that they help you build networks within organizations and communities. Having good soft skills means being approachable, likable, reliable, trustworthy &mdash; basically, someone other people enjoy working with and want to know more about. This opens doors for new opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I often see engineers who are confident with their technical skills but lack communication abilities and struggle to showcase their value to the company they work for. If you think about it from a management perspective, why would anyone hire someone who lacks confidence when there are many great candidates out there who are confident enough to prove themselves?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confidence is such an essential factor in making hiring decisions! There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being humble, though. Just remember that self-confidence that comes from knowing what you&rsquo;re doing helps significantly in putting forward a strong case whenever you need something from management or colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This applies to more than just job security. Remember that other people tend to notice when you bring value into conversations by sharing relevant perspectives or ideas instead of just agreeing with everything everyone says. It shows them that you&rsquo;re worth spending time with because of what you&rsquo;re bringing to the conversation rather than merely because of who you are (or who they think/assume/hope you are).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll find yourself better positioned for promotions, exciting projects at work (with increased responsibility!), more significant influence over critical team decisions, etc. The list goes on!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building good relationships within teams and companies (and community-wide) makes going through bad times easier since there will always be people around who care enough about your situation and want to help. It might be hard at first &mdash; especially if you&rsquo;ve been labeled as &ldquo;not sociable&rdquo; &mdash; but trust me, once this starts happening more often, things will improve dramatically!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Soft Skills That Will Help You</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Communication skills</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>How well can you communicate your ideas, opinions, and problems? It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re presenting at a conference or talking about your project with a client &mdash; communication is key, and it comes down to how well you communicate your point.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Collaboration skills</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Can you work in a team? How well do you communicate with your peers and colleagues? Are you able to delegate tasks and responsibilities, or are you always trying to do everything yourself?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Conflict resolution skills</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Conflict happens in all organizations, be it between coworkers or between customers and the organization. It&rsquo;s all about how we deal with these conflicts. We need to learn how to resolve them to make everyone happy without being too bossy or passive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Emotional intelligence (EQ)</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you know when you&rsquo;re feeling stressed or overwhelmed by certain situations? Do you ever lose your temper? Do you get frustrated when things don&rsquo;t go as planned? Being able to recognize and manage your emotions is essential for your success as an engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Managing your time and priorities</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>How good are your time management skills? Are you continuously overworked yet never get anything done because of it? This is not only bad for productivity but also for your mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>How To Improve Your Soft Skills</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing to remember is that soft skills are not innate qualities. We all can learn how to communicate better, collaborate, and work with others more effectively. It&rsquo;s just a matter of practice. The best thing about soft skills is that you can improve them at any time. It&rsquo;s never too late to start!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some practical tips for developing the best possible social skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Be an active listener</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This one is probably&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;essential communication skill. Listening may seem simple, but it&rsquo;s often not easy to do well, as many people know. When somebody talks to you, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry to reply right away. Take your time and pay attention to what they say! This includes both verbal and non-verbal communication, so watch facial expressions as well as body language!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Respond to feedback</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Feedback is vital for every professional. To improve, you need to know what you&rsquo;re doing well and where you can improve. If somebody gives you feedback, accept it with an open mind and try not to get defensive!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People sometimes give negative feedback in a non-constructive way, but if you take the time to talk about it, usually they&rsquo;ll be willing to elaborate on their point of view. Remember that even though someone is trying to help you become better, they don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball and might be mistaken at times!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Be confident when talking with people</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Communication is useless if it comes from a place of uncertainty or doubt. If you think something could sound awkward or stupid, then it very likely will sound awkward or stupid! So try out sentences before you say them out loud &mdash; in front of a mirror can be useful here because it demonstrates how you look when saying things like &ldquo;Um&hellip; yeah&hellip; I mean&hellip; no&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that confidence does not have anything to do with being arrogant. Instead, it means feeling comfortable enough in your skin to share your ideas confidently and openly with others. That&rsquo;s much better than being afraid of looking silly (which only makes people feel bad about themselves).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Be curious about other people and their ideas</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Never be afraid to ask questions. This creates opportunities for others to learn from you too! And even if they don&rsquo;t have any interesting answers for you right away, keep asking questions until you find something helpful or interesting for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there&rsquo;s some kind of disagreement between two parties during a conversation, try approaching the problem from each side separately. It will help you understand what each person means by their statements more precisely, facilitating collaboration later on (you&rsquo;ll know what kinds of solutions would satisfy each party).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And last but not least, always be open-minded! Being too set in your own opinions can lead you into unnecessary conflicts with other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important thing I&rsquo;d like to mention here is the fact that social skills take time to develop. Just like anything else in life, it will take months &mdash; maybe even years &mdash; until they become second nature (if they ever do). So don&rsquo;t expect yourself and others around you to change immediately after reading this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, focus on improving one area at a time while consciously working towards developing better social skills overall. With enough practice over time, it will eventually become second nature and people will start noticing the changes in how you interact with those around you.</p>\r\n", "userStatus": "publish", "adminStatus": false}}, {"model": "blog.userpost", "pk": 13, "fields": {"authorUsername": 8, "title": "5 Common JavaScript Memory Mistakes", "label": "Tips to avoid memory leaks in your web apps", "category": "avoid these mistakes", "image": "images/userPost/krakenimages-8RXmc8pLX_I-unsplash.jpg", "slug": "5-Common-JavaScript-Memory-Mistakes", "author": "sumit", "dateUpdate": "2021-03-09T14:41:57.119", "timeStamp": "2021-03-09T10:28:26.685", "timeRead": "1.6 min", "content": "<p><img alt=\"Computer chip\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/5184/0*bHJc2tbv1pM_kLTU\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@possessedphotography?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Possessed Photography</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t provide any memory management primitives. Instead, memory is managed by the JavaScript VM through a memory reclaim process. That process is known as Garbage Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we can&rsquo;t force it to run, how do we know it will work properly? What do we know about it?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Script execution is paused during the process.</li>\r\n\t<li>It frees memory for unreachable resources.</li>\r\n\t<li>It is non-deterministic.</li>\r\n\t<li>It will not inspect the whole memory in one go but will run in multiple cycles.</li>\r\n\t<li>It is unpredictable. It will execute when necessary.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Does that mean we don&rsquo;t have to worry about resources and memory allocation? Certainly not. If you aren&rsquo;t careful, you might create some memory leaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What Is a Memory Leak?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>A memory leak is an allocated piece of memory that the software is not able to reclaim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That Javascript provides you with a garbage collection process doesn&rsquo;t mean you are safe from memory leaks. In order to be eligible for garbage collection, the object must not be referenced elsewhere. If you hold references to unused resources, you will be preventing those resources from being unallocated. That is known as unintentional memory retention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaking memory may result in more frequent garbage collector runs. As this process will prevent scripts from running it might slow down your web app. That will make it less snappy, which will be noticed by the user. It can even lead to your web app crashing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can we prevent our web app from leaking memory? It&rsquo;s simple: by avoiding retention of unnecessary resources. Let&rsquo;s look at the most common scenarios where this might happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>1. Timer Listeners</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the&nbsp;<code>setInterval</code>&nbsp;timer. It is a commonly used Web API feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The&nbsp;<code><strong>setInterval()</strong></code>&nbsp;method, offered on the&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window\">Window</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker\">Worker</a></code>&nbsp;interfaces, repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call. It returns an interval ID which uniquely identifies the interval, so you can remove it later by calling&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval\">clearInterval()</a></code>. This method is defined by the&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope\">WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope</a></code>&nbsp;mixin.&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval\">MDN Web Docs</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s create a component that calls a callback function to signal that it is done after&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;cycles. I am using React for this particular example, but this applies to any FE framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, it looks like nothing is wrong. Let&rsquo;s create a component that triggers this timer and analyze its memory performance:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After clicking a few times on the&nbsp;<code>retry</code>&nbsp;button, this is the result we get in memory usage using the Chrome Dev Tools:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Memory usage\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*AY0XlpDVozkeGfxkU5MJ-w.png?q=20\" style=\"height:206px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Memory usage\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/838/1*AY0XlpDVozkeGfxkU5MJ-w.png\" style=\"height:172px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see how more and more memory is allocated as we hit the&nbsp;<code>retry</code>&nbsp;button. That means the previous memory allocated wasn&rsquo;t freed up. The interval timers are still running instead of being replaced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do we fix this? The return of&nbsp;<code>setInterval</code>&nbsp;is an interval ID which we can use to cancel the interval. In this particular scenario, we can call&nbsp;<code>clearInterval</code>&nbsp;once the Component unmounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, spotting these issues in code reviews is hard. The best practice is to create abstractions where you can manage all that complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we are using React here, we can wrap all this logic in a custom Hook:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, whenever you need to use a&nbsp;<code>setInterval</code>, you can do:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nconst handleTimeout = () =&gt; ...;useTimeout(100, handleTimeout);</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you can use this&nbsp;<code>useTimeout</code>&nbsp;Hook without having to worry about memory getting leaked, it&rsquo;s all managed by the abstraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>2. Event Listeners</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The Web API provides plenty of event listeners you can hook yourself to. Previously, we covered&nbsp;<code>setTimeout</code>. Now we will be looking at&nbsp;<code>addEventListener</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s create a keyboard shortcut functionality for our web application. Since we have different functionality on different pages, we will create different shortcut functions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All seems well, except that we didn&rsquo;t clean the previous&nbsp;<code>keyup</code>&nbsp;when we executed the second&nbsp;<code>addEventListener</code>. Instead of replacing our&nbsp;<code>keyup</code>&nbsp;listener, this code will be adding another&nbsp;<code>callback</code>. That means that when a key is pressed, it will trigger both functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To clear the previous callback, we need to use&nbsp;<code>removeEventListener</code>. Let&rsquo;s see a code example:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ndocument.removeEventListener(&lsquo;keyup&rsquo;, homeShortcuts);</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s refactor the code to prevent this unwanted behavior:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a rule of thumb, when using tools from the global object, you need to be careful and responsible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>3. Observers</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Observers are a browser Web API feature that is unknown to a lot of developers. They are powerful if you want to inspect changes in the visibility or size of HTML elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s check the Intersection Observer API for example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport\">viewport</a>.&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver\">MDN Web Docs</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As powerful as it is, you need to use it responsibly. Once you are done observing the object, you need to cancel out the monitor process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see some code:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code above looks fine. However, what happens to the observer once the component is unmounted? It won&rsquo;t be cleared, so you will be leaking memory. How can we solve that? Just by using the&nbsp;<code>disconnect</code>&nbsp;method:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we can be certain that when the component is unmounted, our observer will be disconnected.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>4. Window Object</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding objects to the Window is a common mistake. In some scenarios, it might be hard to find &mdash; especially if you use the&nbsp;<code>this</code>&nbsp;keyword from the Window Execution context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the following example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It looks harmless, but it depends on which context you invoke&nbsp;<code>addElement&nbsp;</code>from. If you invoke&nbsp;<code>addElement</code>&nbsp;from the Window Context, you will start to see items piling up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another issue might be defining a global variable by mistake:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nvar a = &#39;example 1&#39;; // scoped to the place where var was created\r\nb = &#39;example 2&#39;; // added to the Window object</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>To prevent this kind of issue, always execute JavaScript in strict mode:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n&quot;use strict&quot;</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>By using strict mode, you are hinting to the JavaScript compiler that you want to protect yourself from those kinds of behavior. You can still use the Window when you need it. You have to use it in an explicit way, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How strict mode will affect our previous examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>On the&nbsp;<code>addElement</code>&nbsp;function,&nbsp;<code>this</code>&nbsp;will be undefined when invoked from a global scope.</li>\r\n\t<li>If you don&rsquo;t specify&nbsp;<code>const | let | var</code>&nbsp;on a variable, you will get the following error:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nUncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined</pre>\r\n\r\n<h1>5. Holding DOM References</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>DOM nodes are not free from memory leaks either. You need to be careful not to hold references of them. Otherwise, the garbage collector won&rsquo;t be able to clean them, as they are still reachable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see a small code example to illustrate this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the&nbsp;<code>addElement</code>&nbsp;function clears the&nbsp;<code>list</code>&nbsp;div and adds a new element to it as a child. This newly created element is added to the&nbsp;<code>elements</code>&nbsp;array.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next time&nbsp;<code>addElement</code>&nbsp;is executed, that element will be removed from the&nbsp;<code>list</code>&nbsp;div. However, it won&rsquo;t be eligible for garbage collection, as it&rsquo;s stored in the&nbsp;<code>elements</code>&nbsp;array. That makes it reachable. That will make you a&nbsp;<code>Node</code>&nbsp;on each&nbsp;<code>addElement</code>&nbsp;execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s monitor the function after a few executions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Leaked nodes\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*5Ie_oCAJx66YGRD9IM3xig.png?q=20\" style=\"height:188px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Leaked nodes\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1189/1*5Ie_oCAJx66YGRD9IM3xig.png\" style=\"height:111px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can see in the screenshot above how nodes are leaked. How can we fix this? Clearing the&nbsp;<code>elements</code>&nbsp;array will make them eligible for garbage collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we have seen the most common ways in which memory can be leaked. It is clear that JavaScript does not leak memory itself. Rather, it&rsquo;s caused by unintentional memory retention from the developer side. As long as the code is tidy and we don&rsquo;t forget to clean up after ourselves, no leaks will happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding how memory and garbage collection work in JavaScript is a must. Some developers get the false impression that because it is automatic, they don&rsquo;t need to worry about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is recommended to periodically run the browser profiler tools on your web application. That is the only way to be sure that nothing is leaking and left behind. The Chrome Developer&nbsp;<code>performance</code>&nbsp;tab is the place to start detecting some anomalies. After you have spotted an issue, you can dig deeper into it with the&nbsp;<code>profiler</code>&nbsp;tab by taking snapshots and comparing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, we spend our time optimizing methods and forget that memory plays a big part in the performance of our web application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheers!</p>", "userStatus": "publish", "adminStatus": true}}, {"model": "blog.userpost", "pk": 14, "fields": {"authorUsername": 8, "title": "Why Most Programmers End Up Being (or Are) Underperforming Technical Leads", "label": "And how not to be one", "category": "Better prepare yourself in every field", "image": "images/userPost/ben-sweet-2LowviVHZ-E-unsplash.jpg", "slug": "Why-Most-Programmers-End-Up-Being-(or-Are)-Underperforming-Technical-Leads", "author": "sumit", "dateUpdate": "2021-03-09T14:40:43.493", "timeStamp": "2021-03-09T10:39:45.684", "timeRead": "1 min", "content": "<p><img alt=\"Image for post\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/5771/1*y3YW7FgJIknWP7QrCuGQ5Q.jpeg\" style=\"height:465px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@_bahador?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Bahador</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@zackminott/likes?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Meet Bob</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob is an extremely ambitious and overachieving developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He works hard, refines his coding skills on a daily basis, and always finishes a project on or ahead of time &mdash; eager to get started on his next project. You can look at his code and immediately intuit that he&rsquo;s a master at designing and architecting beautifully written code. He loves everything his job has to offer and because of that, he shows up every single day with an energy that allows him to pound out value like a machine. He feels on top of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob is the quintessential programmer that many of us yearn to become. Surely, no one is more deserving of promotion than him? So, Bob was promoted to technical lead, a position that management thought that he&rsquo;d be even more valuable in. Rightfully so. But this also meant that he&rsquo;d write less code and instead would have to focus more on managing the direction of the project as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, he&rsquo;d have to do less of what he loved as a trade-off to do more of what he didn&rsquo;t know how to do &mdash; managing others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He lacked the ability to direct others, empathize with their schedules and knowledge, break tasks down for other people to succeed, and strategize for success. He expected everyone else on his team to be as good as he was as a programmer so he didn&rsquo;t spend the time necessary to invest in their development &mdash; mostly because he couldn&rsquo;t relate to their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the months went on, he proved to be less than capable of performing well in his new position. He had reached a brand new level of incompetence. His better nature and lack of managerial skills through his previous job led him to fail at what he did. This incompetence led his team&rsquo;s productivity to plummet and their organization to crumble.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Peter Principle</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob&rsquo;s situation is a all-too-familiar reality that many of us may recognize. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;ve known a multitude of senior developers and technical leads who are absolute terrible at doing what their job requires&mdash; leading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sad thing is, these poor fellows were probably brilliant earlier in their careers. They have been pushed into a position they weren&rsquo;t well equipped to thrive in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This phenomenon is known as&nbsp;<em>The Peter Principle:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence. [&hellip;] You will see that in every hierarchy&nbsp;<em>the cream rises until it sours</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Laurence J. Peter wrote this bestselling idea as satire, it has proved to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w24343\">unequivocally true</a>&nbsp;&mdash; the idea that a person will be promoted again and again until they eventually reach their level of incompetence. For a developer, this can be mid-level, senior, lead, director, or all the way up to CTO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As developers, it&rsquo;s common to think that if you perform well and are constantly refining your coding skills, you&rsquo;ll be promoted into a more prestigious position &mdash; one that bears far more responsibility and allows you to flex your merit and learned abilities. And that&rsquo;s true &mdash; you most likely will be promoted. That&rsquo;s the way things are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People are generally promoted based on their performance in their current position, not because they hold the skillset necessary to fill the next position. It is merely assumed that they are more capable because of their past performance. Who knows, they probably are more capable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, their capacity to do great things in the past doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to their ability to accomplish great things in positions they fill in the future. For that, their promotion can serve to be a very poor investment in regards to the success of future projects. It&rsquo;s a gamble, not a certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, in all likelihood, you&rsquo;d probably be pretty awful as a manager. That&rsquo;s not to hurt your feelings and undercut your abilities, but it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re so focused on your current job that you won&rsquo;t be prepared for what the future holds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Your own ambition is, paradoxically, a key that unlocks your own mediocrity.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have the skills that make you great as a developer. You might even have the skills that make you a formidable team player. But you lack the skills that would make you great as a leader, architect, or coordinator. Programming alone doesn&rsquo;t particularly develop those leadership-type attributes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s for this reason that so many incompetent people hold positions above us. This is why once brilliant people do horrible things. This is why certain projects go wrong under specific leadership. And no, it&rsquo;s not the team who&rsquo;s at fault &mdash; it&rsquo;s the leader of the pack who failed to create an environment and organized structure for the team to succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. You can&rsquo;t transform the way your organization handles promotions, but you do have control over yourself and your own perception. You can harness your own unique ability to think and act.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Creative Incompetence: The Key to Being Good</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Imposter syndrome is often seen as a bad thing. Of course, possessing the state of mind that you&rsquo;re less competent than your job demands can cripple you. It could cause you to undersell yourself. When you deeply believe that you&rsquo;re not capable, that often manifests as reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s another way of viewing such a mode of thought &mdash; a psychological avenue that you can use to avoid falling victim to&nbsp;<em>The Peter Principle.</em>&nbsp;The adoption of &ldquo;creative incompetence.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative incompetence is similar to imposter syndrome in that you see yourself as incompetent. Except, you foster this mindset in an intentional way. When you intentionally view yourself as incompetent, you might ask yourself questions about how you might be able to alleviate such incompetence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You prepare a strategy. You learn more than just what your job immediately demands of you. You refine your soft skills. You do what it takes to become more than a mere programmer. You take action to become someone dynamic enough to fill in future leadership positions within the realm of development that isn&rsquo;t tied specifically to programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, there&rsquo;s far more to development than programming. In order to maintain yourself as a powerful asset in the long run, you have to prepare now. So, verse yourself not only in programming but in management, strategy, game theory, business philosophy, communication, and whatever else it is that will allow you to lead better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You want to hit the ground running. If you think that because you succeeded in a past position, that you&rsquo;ll succeed in a future position, you&rsquo;re in for a rude awakening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you think you know everything; you know nothing. If you think you know nothing; you know something.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash; Jayce O&rsquo;Neil</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, be creatively incompetent. Believe that you know nothing. See yourself as incompetent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adopt this mindset as a means to better prepare yourself and motivate you to learn beyond what your craft currently demands of you and the future positions that you&rsquo;ll need to fill. Be the developer in an idealized sense. This will allow you to continuously make an impact and improve without reaching a ceiling that limits your growth.</p>", "userStatus": "publish", "adminStatus": true}}, {"model": "quiz.language",
